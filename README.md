# FizzbuzzMVC
Sample project for testing of a ASP.Net MVC controller using a test first approach and the well known FizzBuzz problem.

Demonstrates the FizzBuzz problem, a common programming interview question:

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

Impress interviewers by going the extra mile and using a TDD approach to solve the problem. 

You're hired.
