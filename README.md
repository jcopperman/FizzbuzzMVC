# FizzbuzzMVC
Sample project for testing of a ASP.Net MVC controller using a test first approach to solve the FizzBuzz problem.

The FizzBuzz problem is a common programming interview question designed to test developers:

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

Impress interviewers by going the extra mile and use a TDD approach to solve the problem. 

You're hired.
You're welcome!
